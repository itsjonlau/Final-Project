# Final-Project
## Selected Topic
Our selected topic is healthcare, specifically the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine. We’re looking to research how the rollout of the vaccines has impacted death rates as a result of COVID-19.

## Data Source
We’ve sourced most of our data from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and the US Government.

## Questions to Answer
The overall question we wish to answer is: how does the distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine impact the death rates from the virus?
Each team member has a more specific question that they will answer, listed below:
- Do COVID-19 deaths slow at a different rate for minorities?
- Do COVID-19 deaths slow at a different rate depending on age?
- Do COVID-19 deaths slow at a different rate depending on gender?

## Communication Protocols
The main way our team communicates is via Slack. We also have a video meeting each week to discuss progress and outline next steps.
