# Final-Project
## Selected Topic
Our selected topic is healthcare, specifically the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine. We’re looking to research how the rollout of the vaccines has impacted death rates as a result of COVID-19. We’ve selected this question because of its relevance and because we’re all interested in health data.

## Data Source
We’ve sourced most of our data from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and the US Government. See links below for the data we plan to use:
- https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/provisional-weekly-deaths-by-region-race-age-62c96
- https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Provisional-COVID-19-Death-Counts-by-Sex-Age-and-W/vsak-wrfu
- https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Provisional-COVID-19-Death-Counts-by-Sex-Age-and-S/9bhg-hcku
- https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/covid-19-vaccine-initial-allocations-pfizer
- https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/covid-19-vaccine-distribution-allocations-by-jurisdiction-moderna
- https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccine-Distribution-Allocations-by-Juris/w9zu-fywh 


## Questions to Answer
The overall question we wish to answer is: how does the distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine impact the death rates from the virus?
Each team member has a more specific question that they will answer, listed below:
- Do COVID-19 deaths slow at a different rate for minorities?
- Do COVID-19 deaths slow at a different rate depending on age?
- Do COVID-19 deaths slow at a different rate depending on gender?
- Based on vaccination and infection rates, can you accurately predict if a state voted for Trump or for Biden?

## Communication Protocols
The main way our team communicates is via Slack and commenting back and forth within our Google document. We also have a video meeting each week to discuss progress and outline next steps.

## Machine Learning


## Dashboard
We'll be using Tableau for our dashboard. Each team member will create a visualization to accompany their question. One interactive element we will have is allowing the user to filter the graph by race.
