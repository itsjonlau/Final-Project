# Final-Project
## Selected Topic
Our selected topic is healthcare, specifically the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine. We’re looking to research how the rollout of the vaccines has impacted death rates as a result of COVID-19. We’ve selected this question because of its relevance and because we’re all interested in health data.

## Data Source
We’ve sourced most of our data from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and the US Government. See links below for the data we used:
- https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/provisional-weekly-deaths-by-region-race-age-62c96
- https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Provisional-COVID-19-Death-Counts-by-Sex-Age-and-W/vsak-wrfu
- https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Provisional-COVID-19-Death-Counts-by-Sex-Age-and-S/9bhg-hcku
- https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/covid-19-vaccine-initial-allocations-pfizer
- https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/covid-19-vaccine-distribution-allocations-by-jurisdiction-moderna
- https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccine-Distribution-Allocations-by-Juris/w9zu-fywh 

## Questions to Answer
The overall question we wish to answer is: how does the distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine impact the death rates from the virus?
Each team member has a more specific question that they will answer, listed below:
- Do COVID-19 deaths slow at a different rate for minorities?
- Do COVID-19 deaths slow at a different rate depending on age?
- Do COVID-19 deaths slow at a different rate depending on gender?
- Based on vaccination and infection rates, can you accurately predict if a state voted for Trump or for Biden?

## Data Exploration and Analysis
### Data Exploration
- We used Pandas to clean and reformatted the code to fit our needs. One important item was combining the different vaccination datasets from each pharmaceutical company into just one dataset. Many of the datasets had extraneous data that we could drop as it wasn't relevant to our specific questions. Many of us also had to re-categorize the data tot ensure it was more clear visually.
- Where applicable, we joined separate datasets into one database using SQL.

### Data Analysis
Each of us conducted analysis to answer our own question. For the ones related to death rates, it made the most sense to use a line graph, as we wanted to show how the data changed over time. To answer other questions, it made the most sense to use machine learning models like regression.

## Tools
Throughout the project, we used a variety of technologies, languages and tools, including:
- GitHub
- PostgreSQL
- Python
- Pandas 
- Jupyter Notebook

## Communication Protocols
The main way our team communicates is via Slack and commenting back and forth within our Google document. We also have a video meeting each week to discuss progress and outline next steps.

## Machine Learning

## Result
Overall, there does appear to be a significant decline in COVID-19 deaths once the vaccine is introduced. This decline is present in general, as well as within all races and all age groups.

## Key Learnings
- Try to find data that is already normalized (versus counts) as that is what is ultimately more important, easier to pull insights from and tells a more clear story.
