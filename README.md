Boot Camp Final Project
Justin O'Brien: predicting whether the state voted for trump or biden based on vaccination rates, infection rates, polling data on vaccine willingness, statewide vaccine supply used, poll data on willingness to wear a mask in public 

#DATA BASE
Using sql, i will build a relational database from all the data i will be collecting.  A large amount of the work will be extracting the data that is needed from the csv files that i have pulled.  Some are much more expansive than needed.  I will also lively have to build the tables that are using poll data because they are not available as a csv.  this wont be difficult and the primary keys will be the states (for mask data, vaccine willingness data, and the 2020 election result data).
primary key of States will be essential becasue we will have to merge all the tables created on the state column.  once everything is cleaned and pulled into one large dataset, we will then be able to perform any type of analysis we would like within SQL.
