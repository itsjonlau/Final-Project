# Final-Project
## Selected Topic
Our selected topic is healthcare, specifically the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine. We’re looking to research how the rollout of the vaccines has impacted death rates as a result of COVID-19. We’ve selected this question because of its relevance and because we’re all interested in health data.

## Data Source
We’ve sourced most of our data from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and the US Government. See links below for the data we used:
- https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/provisional-weekly-deaths-by-region-race-age-62c96
- https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Provisional-COVID-19-Death-Counts-by-Sex-Age-and-W/vsak-wrfu
- https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Provisional-COVID-19-Death-Counts-by-Sex-Age-and-S/9bhg-hcku
- https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/covid-19-vaccine-initial-allocations-pfizer
- https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/covid-19-vaccine-distribution-allocations-by-jurisdiction-moderna
- https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccine-Distribution-Allocations-by-Juris/w9zu-fywh 

## Questions to Answer
The overall question we wish to answer is: how does the distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine impact the death rates from the virus?
Each team member has a more specific question that they will answer, listed below:
- Do COVID-19 deaths slow at a different rate for minorities?
- Do COVID-19 deaths slow at a different rate depending on age?
- Do COVID-19 deaths slow at a different rate depending on gender?
- Based on vaccination and infection rates, can you accurately predict if a state voted for Trump or for Biden?

## Data Exploration
- Used Pandas to clean and reformatted the code to fit our needs. For example, one important item was combining the different vaccination datasets from each pharmaceutical company into just one dataset. 
- Where applicable, we joined separate datasets into one database using SQL.

## Tools
Throughout the project, we used a variety of technologies, languages and tools, including:
-GitHub
-PostgreSQL
-Python


## Communication Protocols
The main way our team communicates is via Slack and commenting back and forth within our Google document. We also have a video meeting each week to discuss progress and outline next steps.
